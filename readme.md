## Opening
What is a calculator? How do we use one? Let's walk through every step we have to go through to figure out 10+11.
For 10+11, what are the operands? What's the operator? And what's the result? You are going to build the guts of a two-operand, integer calculator. You will be given some starter code.

## Instructions
You are to modify `js/guts.js`. You will add the following functions to it:
```
    multiply(x,y);
    subtract(x,y);
    add(x,y);
```
Note that `divide(x,y)` is already implemented for you as a sample.

## Additional guidelines
* Your functions must be named the same and take in the same parameters.
* Do not modify any of the other files.

## Brainstorming
Before you start coding, identify the list of steps you need to do to finish this project. Here's a start:
On paper, write down the formulas for each of the functions. Note the parameters you have to deal with.
Bring the starter code into your own environment.
Successfully solve your favorite function. Make sure it works before moving on to others.

## Bonus
If you are done with adding functions for the three buttons you can work on:

* Adding functions to calculate square root, log, and random. The random number button should generate a number between 1 and 1000. Here are the functions:
```
    power(x,y);
    square_root(x);
    logBase10(x);
    generateRandomNumber();
```

* Get creative and style the calculator however you like.
